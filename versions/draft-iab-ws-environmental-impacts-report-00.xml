<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 on exploring
and understanding the environmental impacts of the Internet.</t>

<t>The background for the workshop was that Internet communications and
applications have both environmental costs and benefits. In the
positive direction, they can reduce the environmental impact of our
society, for instance, by allowing virtual interaction to replace
physical travel. Of course, the Internet can equally well act as an
enabler for increasing physical goods consumption, for instance,
through easing commerce.</t>

<t>Beyond the effects associated with its use, Internet applications do
not come for free either. The Internet runs on systems that require
energy and raw materials to manufacture and operate. While the
environmental benefits of the Internet may certainly outweigh this use
of resources in many cases, it is incumbent on the Internet industry
to ensure that this use of resources is minimized and optimized. In
many cases, this is already an economic necessity due to operational
costs. And because many consumers, businesses, and civil societies
care deeply about the environmental impact of the services and
technologies they use, there is also a clear demand for providing
Internet services with minimal environmental impact.</t>

<t>The role of the workshop was to discuss the Internet’s environmental
impact, discuss the evolving needs from industry, and to identify
areas for improvements and future work. A key goal of the workshop was
to call further attention to the topic and to bring together a diverse
stakeholder community to discuss these issues. This report summarises
the workshop inputs and discussions.</t>

<t>The workshop drew many position paper submissions. Of these, 26 were
accepted and published to stimulate discussion. There were active
discussions both in the meeting and on the workshop mailing list with
altogether 73 participants.</t>

<t>Perhaps the main overriding observation is how much there is interest
and urgency on this topic, among engineers, researchers, and
businesses.</t>

<t>The workshop discussions and conclusions are covered in <xref target="discussions"/>.
The position papers, and links to recordings of workshop sessions, can
be found at https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/e-impact/.
Presentations held during the discussions can be found from the IETF
Datatracker at https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/eimpactws/meetings/.</t>

<t>The discussion at the IETF will continue after the workshop, both
around specific proposals as well as general discussion on a new
mailing list, the e-impact list (e-impact@ietf.org). You can subscribe
to this list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/e-impact.</t>

<t>Some improvements addressing specific situations are
being discussed at the IETF, such as the Time Variant Routing (TVR)
proposal that can help optimize connectivity with systems that are
periodically on or reachable (such as satellites). We expect more
proposals in the future.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="scope" title="Scope">

<t>Environmental impact assessment and improvements are broad topics,
ranging from technical questions to economics, business decisions, and
policies.</t>

<t>The technical, standards, and research communities can help
ensure that we have a sufficient understanding of the environmental
impact of the Internet and its applications. They can also help to
design the right tools to continue to build and improve all aspects of
the Internet, such as addressing new functional needs, easing of
operations, improving performance and/or efficiency, or reducing
environmental impacts in other ways.</t>

<t>The workshop was expected to discuss:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The direct environmental impacts of the Internet, including but not
limited to energy usage by Internet systems themselves, energy usage
of the relevant end-user devices, resources needed for manufacturing
the associated devices, or the environmental impacts throughout the
life-cycle of Internet systems. This included discussion about the
breakdown of those impacts across different system components and
operations, and predictions about the potential future trends for
these impacts based on changed usage patterns and emerging
technologies.</t>
  <t>Discussion of the indirect environmental impacts of the Internet,
i.e., its effects on society through enabling communications,
virtual services, or global commerce.</t>
  <t>Sharing information about relevant measurement metrics and data, and
identify the need for additional metric or measurements.</t>
  <t>Discussing about the need for improvements or associated new
functionality.</t>
  <t>Sharing information about the societal, business, and regulatory
situation, to help identify areas of opportunity.</t>
  <t>Identifying areas where further technical work would be most impactful.</t>
  <t>Discussing specific improvement proposals.</t>
  <t>Discussion of past work in the IETF, IRTF, and IAB in this area and
the status of such work.</t>
  <t>Discussion of observed user behaviours as they relate to
environmental impacts.</t>
</list></t>

<t>We expected that the workshop discussions connect analysis of the issues
(e.g., scale of energy consumption or carbon footprint) to industry
needs (e.g., deployment opportunities) and solutions.</t>

<t>Business and societal policy questions were in scope only insofar as
they inform the workshop participants about the context we are in, but
what those policies should be was not for the workshop to decide or
even extensively discuss. The scope excluded also how the technical
community works and meets, such as the question of in-person or hybrid
meetings (although it should be noted that the workshop itself was
run as an on-line meeting).</t>

<section anchor="practical-arrangements" title="Practical Arrangements">

<t>The IAB discussed a potential workshop in this area during its May
2022 retreat. A call for position papers went out in August
2022. Position papers were to be submitted by end of October, a
deadline which was later extended by one week.</t>

<t>As noted, the workshop itself was run as an on-line meeting, with four
half-day long sessions complemented by email discussions and the
position papers submitted by the participants.</t>

<t>All in all, 73 people participated in at least one session in the
workshop. Participation was by invitation only, based on the position
paper submissions.</t>

<t>The program committee decided that due to interest and differing areas
of expertise, all co-authors were to be invited, and most of them did
attend. The program committee also invited a handful of additional
participants, where they were seen as providing valuable
input. Similarly, as is traditional in IAB workshops, the program
committee members and members of the IAB and IESG were offered an
opportunity to participate even in cases where they did not submit a
position paper.</t>

<t>The IETF secretariat and communications staff provided practical
support during the process, sending announcements, maintaining the
workshop web page with position papers, setting up mailing lists,
tracking submissions, helping with blog article submissions, and so
on.</t>

<section anchor="discussions" title="Workshop Topics and Discussion">

<t>The meeting part of the workshop was divided into four sessions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The first session was about the big picture and relationships
between different aspects of sustainability (see <xref target="session1"/>).</t>
  <t>The second session focused on what we know and do not know, and how
we can measure environmental impacts (see <xref target="session2"/>).</t>
  <t>The third session was about potential improvements (see <xref target="session3"/>).</t>
  <t>The final fourth session was about conclusions and next steps (see
<xref target="session4"/>).</t>
</list></t>

<section anchor="session1" title="The Big Picture">

<t>This session was about the big picture and how the Internet
influences the rest of the society. We also spoke about the goals of
the workshop.</t>

<t>The session began with a discussion about what is overall involved in
this topic.  We also looked at how the IETF has approached
this topic in the past.</t>

<t>The discussions also expressed the urgency of action and the
importance of continuous improvement: an incremental change every year
is needed for larger savings at the end of the decade. We continued to
talk about the need to recognize how climate changes impact different
communities in the world, often unfairly. Finally, we focused on the
need to be aware of carbon footprint rather than pure energy
consumption - carbon intensity of energy sources varies.</t>

<t>The starting observation from this session was that the issue is much
bigger than our technology alone.  The issue influences all parts of
society, and even matters such as (in)equality, externalized costs,
and justice. Another key observation was that improvements come in
many forms; there is no silver bullet. The opportunity to bring
together people with different backgrounds helped us see how we
approach the topic from different angles - none of them wrong, but
also none of the sole angle to focus on either. Only the combined
effects of complementary efforts can provide the required level of changes.</t>

<t>Some of the useful tools for approaching the issue included of course
technical solutions, but also solidarity, aiming for sufficiency, and
awareness. It is important to not stand still waiting for the perfect
solution. Renewable energy and carbon awareness were seen as a part of
the solution, but not, however, sufficient by themselves.</t>

<t>As an example demonstration of the diversity of angles and
improvements relating to environmental issues, the figure below
classifies the areas that workshop position papers fell on:</t>

<t>Some of the goals for the IETF should include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Connecting IETF with others. Given that the issue is broad, it is
difficult for one standards organisation alone to make a significant
impact, or even have the full picture. Working in collaboration
others is necessary.  And understanding the situation beyond
technology will be needed.</t>
  <t>Continuous improvement. It is important that the IETF (among others)
sets itself on a continuous improvement cycle. No single improvement
will change the overall situation sufficiently, but over a longer
period of time, even smaller changes every year will result in
larger improvements.</t>
  <t>Finding the right targets for improvements in the Internet. These
should perhaps not be solely defined by larger speeds or bigger
capacity, but rather increased usefulness to society and declining
emissions from ICT.</t>
  <t>Specifying what research needs to be done, i.e., where additional
knowledge would allow us to find better improvements. For instance,
not enough is known about environmental impacts beyond energy, such
as natural resources used for manufacturing, or the use of
water. Carbon-awareness and measurements across domains is also
poorly understood today. And business model impacts – such as the
role of advertising on Internet’s carbon footprint – deserve more
study.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="session2" title="Understanding the Impacts">

<t>The second session focused on what we know and do not know, and how we
can measure environmental impacts.</t>

<t>The initial presentation from focused on narrowing down
the lower and upper limits of the energy use of the Internet. There
was also discussion regarding the energy consumption of the ICT sector
and how it compares to some other selected industries such as
aviation. Dwelling deeper into the energy consumption and the carbon
footprint of the ICT sector there was discussion regarding how the
impact was split amongst the networks, data centres and user devices
(with the user devices appearing to contribute to the largest fraction
of the impact).</t>

<t>There were also further discussions both during the presentations and in
the hallway chats regarding the press and media coverage of the potential
environment technologies. The overall sense of the participants seemed to
be that there was a lot of sensational headlines, but they were not really
backed by measurements done by the industry and academia, and were fraught
with errors. Some of these media reports were off by quite a bit, sometimes
even by an order of magnitude (e.g., confusing MBps vs Mbps in calculations).</t>

<t>In the rest of the session we looked at both
additional data collected from the operators as well as factors that -
depending on circumstances - may drive energy consumption. These
include for instance peak capacity and energy proportionality.</t>

<t>If energy consumption is little affected by offered load, the ratio of
peak capacity to typical usage becomes a critical factor in energy
consumption. On the other hand, systems with energy proportionality
scale their resource and energy consumption more dynamically based on
offered load. There were also observations that showed that the energy
consumption grew as a step function when the peak capacity was
reached (even instantaneously) and additional capacity was built up by
performing network upgrades to handle these new peaks. This resulted
in a overall higher baseline energy consumption even when the average
demand did not change that much. Thus, the ability to shift load to
reduce peak demand was highlighted as a potential way to delay
increases in consumption when energy proportionality is lacking.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="session3" title="Improvements">

<t>The third session was about potential improvements.</t>

<t>As noted earlier, there are many different types of improvements. In
the discussion we focused mostly on protocol aspects, and looked at
metrics, telemetry, routing, multicast, and data encoding formats.</t>

<t>The initial two presentations focused on metrics and telemetry with
the premise that visibility is a very important first step
(paraphrasing Peter Drucker’s mantra of “You cannot improve what you
don’t measure”).  There was a discussion of the scopes of emissions
and it seemed that from a networking vendor perspective, while
directly controlled emissions and emissions from purchased energy are
easily measurable, emissions from across the entire value chain can be
much larger. Thus it seemed important that the networking vendors had to put
in effort into helping their customers measure and mitigate their
environmental impact as well. The need for standardized metrics was
very clear as it helps avoid proprietary, redundant and even
contradictory metrics across vendors.</t>

<t>The initial and the near-term focus was related to metrics and techniques
related to energy consumption of the networking devices themselves while
the longer term focus can go into topics much further removed from the IETF
such as packaging, circular design in order to form a more holistic picture.
The overall feeling was that the topic of metrics, telemetry, and management
are quite specific and could be targets to be worked in the IETF in the near
term.</t>

<t>The next part of the discussion highlighted the need to understand the
trade-offs involved in changing forwarding decisions - such as
increased stretch and jitter. This points to the need for careful
design and analysis of improvements from a system perspective, to
ensure that the intended effect is indeed reached across the entire
system, and is not only a local optima.</t>

<t>We also talked about the potentially significant impact of using
efficiency binary formats when carrying data in protocols. This is
something that can be relatively easily adopted in new protocols as
they are developed. Indeed, some recently finished protocols such as
HTTP/2 have already chosen to use this technique.</t>

<t>There were also some interesting discussions regarding the
use of multicast and whether it would help or hurt on the energy
efficiency of communications. There were some studies and simulations
that showed the potential gains to be had but were to be balanced against
some of the well known barriers to deployment of multicast. We also heard
from a leading CDN operator regarding their views on multicast and how it
relates to media usage and consumption models. The hallway conversations
also talked about the potential negative effects of multicast in wireless
and constrained networks. Overall the conclusion was that the use of
multicast can potentially provide some savings but only in some specific
scenarios.</t>

<t>For all improvements, the importance of metrics was frequently
highlighted to ensure changes lead to a meaningful reduction in
overall system carbon footprint.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="session4" title="Next Steps">

<t>The final fourth session was about conclusions and next steps. This
section highlights some of these conclusions.</t>

<section anchor="overall-strategy" title="Overall strategy">

<t>While only a few things are easy, the road ahead for making
improvements seems clear: we need to continue to improve our
understanding of the environmental impact, and have a continuous cycle
of improvements that lead not just to better energy efficiency but to
reduced overall carbon emissions. The IETF can play an important part
in this process, but of course there are other aspects beyond
protocols.</t>

<t>On understanding our environmental impact the first step is better
awareness of sustainability issues in general, which helps us
understand better where our issues are. The second step is willigness
to understand in detail what the causes and relationships within our
issues. What parts, components, or behaviours in the network cause
what kinds of impacts? An overall drive in the society to report and improve
environmental impacts can be helpful in creating a willingness to get
to this information.</t>

<t>On establishing a continuous cycle of improvements, the ability to
understand where we are, making improvements, and then seeing the
impact of those improvements is of course central. But obviously a key
question is what are the potential improvements, and how can we
accelerate them? It should be noted that quick, large changes are not
likely. But a continuous stream of smaller changes can create a large
impact over a longer period of time.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="improvements" title="Improvements">

<t>In looking at potential improvements, it is essential that the
associated tradeoffs can be understood, and that the role of the
Internet in improving other areas of society is not diminished. For
instance, discussion in session three revealed how some changes might
impact latency and jitter. Given that these characteristics are an
important factor how virtual meetings are perceived by potential
participants, it is important that the performance of networks
satisfies these participants at a level where there’s willingness to
use them over other potentially more environmentally harmful methods,
such as travel.</t>

<t>Note that while virtual meetings are a common example, important to
consider different use cases, some of which may not be as obvious to
us human users as meetings are. Improvements may bring different or
even larger impacts in other situations, e.g., Internet connected
electronics might benefit from different characteristics than human
users, e.g., with regards to support for intermittent connectivity.</t>

<t>The relationships between different system components and the impact
of various detailed design choices in network is not always
apparent. A local change in one node may have an impact in other
nodes. When considering environmental sustainability, in most cases
the overall system impact is what counts more than local impacts. Of
course, other factors, such as device battery life and availability of
power may result in other preferences, such as optimising for low
power usage of end-user devices, even at the cost of increases
elsewhere.</t>

<t>In terms of useful tools for building improvements, the following were
highlighted in discussions:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Masures beyond protocol design, such as implementations or renewable
energy use. Not everything is about protocols.</t>
  <t>Metrics, measurements, and data are very beneficial. Carbon-aware
metrics would in particular be very useful. All additional
information makes us more aware of what the environmental impacts
are, but also enables optimization, AI-based adjustments, or
carbon-directed computing and networking tools, and so on.</t>
  <t>It would be beneficial to be able to provide various systems a more
dynamic ability to slow down and sleep.  Awareness of energy
availability and type would also allow us to employ time and place
shifting for reducing carbon impacts.</t>
  <t>When we design systems, paying attention to the used data formats
may pay off significantly, as argued in <xref target="Moran"/>.</t>
  <t>Possibly there’s a new opportunity for deploying multicast as well <xref target="Navarre"/>.</t>
  <t>Designing systems for energy constrained situations may actually
make the resulting systems work well in several environments.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="actions" title="Actions">

<t>The workshop discussed a number of possible actions. These actions are
not about how to take specific technical solutions forward, but rather
about how to discuss the topic going forward or what technical areas
to focus on:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>We need to continue the discussion – not all questions are
 answered. Additional discussion within the IETF will be needed.
 Continuing to connect the IETF with others in society and other SDOs
 around this topic is also useful.</t>
  <t>It is useful to find a role and a scope for IETF work in this
area. IETF will not develop alternative energy sources, work on
social issues or have detailed discussions about implementation
strategies or electronics design. However, IETF has a role in
measurement mechanisms, protocol design and standards – but of
course activities in this role need to be aware of other aspects,
such as implementation strategies.</t>
  <t>There are IETF activities on specific technologies are already
 ongoing/starting, such as metrics, or the new Time Variant Routing
 (TVR) working group. It may be useful to start from picking the
 low-hanging fruits, such as focusing on the use of efficient data
 formats, avoiding crypto assets, and being able to carry
 information that needs to be shared for the purposes of enabling
 load and time shifting.</t>
  <t>Help initiate research activities that address some of the issues,
such as broader gathering and sharing of measurement data, analysis
of this data and looking business related issues such as the impact
of peering or advertising impacts sustainability.  In addition,
there may be need to look at research for specific areas of
improvements that are promising but not ready for standards
discussion.</t>
</list></t>

<t>In summary, the goals that the IETF should have include:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Full understanding of Internet’s environmental impact</t>
  <t>Continuous improvement of our technology.</t>
  <t>Launching research relevant activities.</t>
</list></t>

</section>
<section anchor="feedback" title="Feedback">

<t>The organizers received generally positive feedback about the workshop.</t>

<t>One practical issue from the organizer’s point of view was that due to
the extension of the deadline, the final submissions and paper reviews
collided in part with the IETF-115 meeting. This lead to it being very
difficult for the program committee and practical organization staff
to find time for the activity. We recommend avoiding such collisions
in the future.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="security-considerations" title="Security Considerations">

<t>The workshop itself did not address specific security topics. Of
course, individual changes in Internet technology or operations that
influence environmental impacts may also influence security
aspects. These need to be looked at for every proposed change.</t>

<t>Such influence on security may come in different forms. For instance:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Streamlining what data is sent may improve privacy if less information
is shared.</t>
  <t>A mechanism that makes energy consumption information available may
be susceptible to tampering or providing false information.</t>
  <t>A mechanism that allows control of network elements for optimization
purposes may be misused to cause denial-of-service or other types of
attacks.</t>
