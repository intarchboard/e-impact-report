1.  Introduction

   The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 on exploring and
   understanding the environmental impacts of the Internet.

   The background for the workshop was that Internet communications and
   applications have both environmental costs and benefits.  In the
   positive direction, they can reduce the environmental impact of our
   society, for instance, by allowing virtual interaction to replace
   physical travel.  Of course, the Internet can equally well act as an
   enabler for increasing physical goods consumption, for instance,
   through easing commerce.

   Beyond the effects associated with its use, Internet applications do
   not come for free either.  The Internet runs on systems that require
   energy and raw materials to manufacture and operate.  While the
   environmental benefits of the Internet may certainly outweigh this
   use of resources in many cases, it is incumbent on the Internet
   industry to ensure that this use of resources is minimized and
   optimized.  In many cases, this is already an economic necessity due
   to operational costs.  And because many consumers, businesses, and
   civil societies care deeply about the environmental impact of the
   services and technologies they use, there is also a clear demand for
   providing Internet services with minimal environmental impact.

   The role of the workshop was to discuss the Internet's environmental
   impact, discuss the evolving needs from industry, and to identify
   areas for improvements and future work.  A key goal of the workshop
   was to call further attention to the topic and to bring together a
   diverse stakeholder community to discuss these issues.  This report
   summarises the workshop inputs and discussions.

   The workshop drew many position paper submissions.  Of these, 26 were
   accepted and published to stimulate discussion.  There were active
   discussions both in the meeting and on the workshop mailing list with
   altogether 73 participants.

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


   Perhaps the main overriding observation is how much there is interest
   and urgency on this topic, among engineers, researchers, and
   businesses.

   The workshop discussions and conclusions are covered in Section 3.
   The position papers, and links to recordings of workshop sessions,
   can be found at https://www.iab.org/activities/workshops/e-impact/.
   Presentations held during the discussions can be found from the IETF
   Datatracker at https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/eimpactws/
   meetings/.

   The discussion at the IETF will continue after the workshop, both
   around specific proposals as well as general discussion on a new
   mailing list, the e-impact list (e-impact@ietf.org).  You can
   subscribe to this list at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/
   e-impact.

   Some improvements addressing specific situations are being discussed
   at the IETF, such as the Time Variant Routing (TVR) proposal that can
   help optimize connectivity with systems that are periodically on or
   reachable (such as satellites).  We expect more proposals in the
   future.

2.  Scope

   Environmental impact assessment and improvements are broad topics,
   ranging from technical questions to economics, business decisions,
   and policies.

   The technical, standards, and research communities can help ensure
   that we have a sufficient understanding of the environmental impact
   of the Internet and its applications.  They can also help to design
   the right tools to continue to build and improve all aspects of the
   Internet, such as addressing new functional needs, easing of
   operations, improving performance and/or efficiency, or reducing
   environmental impacts in other ways.

   The workshop was expected to discuss:

   o  The direct environmental impacts of the Internet, including but
      not limited to energy usage by Internet systems themselves, energy
      usage of the relevant end-user devices, resources needed for
      manufacturing the associated devices, or the environmental impacts
      throughout the life-cycle of Internet systems.  This included
      discussion about the breakdown of those impacts across different
      system components and operations, and predictions about the
      potential future trends for these impacts based on changed usage
      patterns and emerging technologies.

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


   o  Discussion of the indirect environmental impacts of the Internet,
      i.e., its effects on society through enabling communications,
      virtual services, or global commerce.

   o  Sharing information about relevant measurement metrics and data,
      and identify the need for additional metric or measurements.

   o  Discussing about the need for improvements or associated new
      functionality.

   o  Sharing information about the societal, business, and regulatory
      situation, to help identify areas of opportunity.

   o  Identifying areas where further technical work would be most
      impactful.

   o  Discussing specific improvement proposals.

   o  Discussion of past work in the IETF, IRTF, and IAB in this area
      and the status of such work.

   o  Discussion of observed user behaviours as they relate to
      environmental impacts.

   We expected that the workshop discussions connect analysis of the
   issues (e.g., scale of energy consumption or carbon footprint) to
   industry needs (e.g., deployment opportunities) and solutions.

   Business and societal policy questions were in scope only insofar as
   they inform the workshop participants about the context we are in,
   but what those policies should be was not for the workshop to decide
   or even extensively discuss.  The scope excluded also how the
   technical community works and meets, such as the question of in-
   person or hybrid meetings (although it should be noted that the
   workshop itself was run as an on-line meeting).

2.1.  Practical Arrangements

   The IAB discussed a potential workshop in this area during its May
   2022 retreat.  A call for position papers went out in August 2022.
   Position papers were to be submitted by end of October, a deadline
   which was later extended by one week.

   As noted, the workshop itself was run as an on-line meeting, with
   four half-day long sessions complemented by email discussions and the
   position papers submitted by the participants.

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


   All in all, 73 people participated in at least one session in the
   workshop.  Participation was by invitation only, based on the
   position paper submissions.

   The program committee decided that due to interest and differing
   areas of expertise, all co-authors were to be invited, and most of
   them did attend.  The program committee also invited a handful of
   additional participants, where they were seen as providing valuable
   input.  Similarly, as is traditional in IAB workshops, the program
   committee members and members of the IAB and IESG were offered an
   opportunity to participate even in cases where they did not submit a
   position paper.

   The IETF secretariat and communications staff provided practical
   support during the process, sending announcements, maintaining the
   workshop web page with position papers, setting up mailing lists,
   tracking submissions, helping with blog article submissions, and so
   on.

3.  Workshop Topics and Discussion

   The meeting part of the workshop was divided into four sessions:

   o  The first session was about the big picture and relationships
      between different aspects of sustainability (see Section 3.1).

   o  The second session focused on what we know and do not know, and
      how we can measure environmental impacts (see Section 3.2).

   o  The third session was about potential improvements (see
      Section 3.3).

   o  The final fourth session was about conclusions and next steps (see
      Section 3.4).

3.1.  The Big Picture

   This session was about the big picture and how the Internet
   influences the rest of the society.  We also spoke about the goals of
   the workshop.

   The session began with a discussion about what is overall involved in
   this topic.  We also looked at how the IETF has approached this topic
   in the past.

   The discussions also expressed the urgency of action and the
   importance of continuous improvement: an incremental change every
   year is needed for larger savings at the end of the decade.  We

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


   continued to talk about the need to recognize how climate changes
   impact different communities in the world, often unfairly.  Finally,
   we focused on the need to be aware of carbon footprint rather than
   pure energy consumption - carbon intensity of energy sources varies.

   The starting observation from this session was that the issue is much
   bigger than our technology alone.  The issue influences all parts of
   society, and even matters such as (in)equality, externalized costs,
   and justice.  Another key observation was that improvements come in
   many forms; there is no silver bullet.  The opportunity to bring
   together people with different backgrounds helped us see how we
   approach the topic from different angles - none of them wrong, but
   also none of the sole angle to focus on either.  Only the combined
   effects of complementary efforts can provide the required level of
   changes.

   Some of the useful tools for approaching the issue included of course
   technical solutions, but also solidarity, aiming for sufficiency, and
   awareness.  It is important to not stand still waiting for the
   perfect solution.  Renewable energy and carbon awareness were seen as
   a part of the solution, but not, however, sufficient by themselves.

   As an example demonstration of the diversity of angles and
   improvements relating to environmental issues, the figure below
   classifies the areas that workshop position papers fell on:

   Some of the goals for the IETF should include:

   o  Connecting IETF with others.  Given that the issue is broad, it is
      difficult for one standards organisation alone to make a
      significant impact, or even have the full picture.  Working in
      collaboration others is necessary.  And understanding the
      situation beyond technology will be needed.

   o  Continuous improvement.  It is important that the IETF (among
      others) sets itself on a continuous improvement cycle.  No single
      improvement will change the overall situation sufficiently, but
      over a longer period of time, even smaller changes every year will
      result in larger improvements.

   o  Finding the right targets for improvements in the Internet.  These
      should perhaps not be solely defined by larger speeds or bigger
      capacity, but rather increased usefulness to society and declining
      emissions from ICT.

   o  Specifying what research needs to be done, i.e., where additional
      knowledge would allow us to find better improvements.  For
      instance, not enough is known about environmental impacts beyond
      energy, such as natural resources used for manufacturing, or the
      use of water.  Carbon-awareness and measurements across domains is



Arkko, et al.            Expires August 4, 2023                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


      also poorly understood today.  And business model impacts - such
      as the role of advertising on Internet's carbon footprint -
      deserve more study.

3.2.  Understanding the Impacts

   The second session focused on what we know and do not know, and how
   we can measure environmental impacts.

   The initial presentation from focused on narrowing down the lower and
   upper limits of the energy use of the Internet.  There was also
   discussion regarding the energy consumption of the ICT sector and how
   it compares to some other selected industries such as aviation.
   Dwelling deeper into the energy consumption and the carbon footprint
   of the ICT sector there was discussion regarding how the impact was
   split amongst the networks, data centres and user devices (with the
   user devices appearing to contribute to the largest fraction of the
   impact).

   There were also further discussions both during the presentations and
   in the hallway chats regarding the press and media coverage of the
   potential environment technologies.  The overall sense of the
   participants seemed to be that there was a lot of sensational
   headlines, but they were not really backed by measurements done by
   the industry and academia, and were fraught with errors.  Some of
   these media reports were off by quite a bit, sometimes even by an
   order of magnitude (e.g., confusing MBps vs Mbps in calculations).

   In the rest of the session we looked at both additional data
   collected from the operators as well as factors that - depending on
   circumstances - may drive energy consumption.  These include for
   instance peak capacity and energy proportionality.

   If energy consumption is little affected by offered load, the ratio
   of peak capacity to typical usage becomes a critical factor in energy
   consumption.  On the other hand, systems with energy proportionality
   scale their resource and energy consumption more dynamically based on
   offered load.  There were also observations that showed that the
   energy consumption grew as a step function when the peak capacity was
   reached (even instantaneously) and additional capacity was built up
   by performing network upgrades to handle these new peaks.  This
   resulted in a overall higher baseline energy consumption even when
   the average demand did not change that much.  Thus, the ability to
   shift load to reduce peak demand was highlighted as a potential way
   to delay increases in consumption when energy proportionality is
   lacking.

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


3.3.  Improvements

   The third session was about potential improvements.

   As noted earlier, there are many different types of improvements.  In
   the discussion we focused mostly on protocol aspects, and looked at
   metrics, telemetry, routing, multicast, and data encoding formats.

   The initial two presentations focused on metrics and telemetry with
   the premise that visibility is a very important first step
   (paraphrasing Peter Drucker's mantra of "You cannot improve what you
   don't measure").  There was a discussion of the scopes of emissions
   and it seemed that from a networking vendor perspective, while
   directly controlled emissions and emissions from purchased energy are
   easily measurable, emissions from across the entire value chain can
   be much larger.  Thus it seemed important that the networking vendors
   had to put in effort into helping their customers measure and
   mitigate their environmental impact as well.  The need for
   standardized metrics was very clear as it helps avoid proprietary,
   redundant and even contradictory metrics across vendors.

   The initial and the near-term focus was related to metrics and
   techniques related to energy consumption of the networking devices
   themselves while the longer term focus can go into topics much
   further removed from the IETF such as packaging, circular design in
   order to form a more holistic picture.  The overall feeling was that
   the topic of metrics, telemetry, and management are quite specific
   and could be targets to be worked in the IETF in the near term.

   The next part of the discussion highlighted the need to understand
   the trade-offs involved in changing forwarding decisions - such as
   increased stretch and jitter.  This points to the need for careful
   design and analysis of improvements from a system perspective, to
   ensure that the intended effect is indeed reached across the entire
   system, and is not only a local optima.

   We also talked about the potentially significant impact of using
   efficiency binary formats when carrying data in protocols.  This is
   something that can be relatively easily adopted in new protocols as
   they are developed.  Indeed, some recently finished protocols such as
   HTTP/2 have already chosen to use this technique.

   There were also some interesting discussions regarding the use of
   multicast and whether it would help or hurt on the energy efficiency
   of communications.  There were some studies and simulations that
   showed the potential gains to be had but were to be balanced against
   some of the well known barriers to deployment of multicast.  We also
   heard from a leading CDN operator regarding their views on multicast



Arkko, et al.            Expires August 4, 2023                 [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


   and how it relates to media usage and consumption models.  The
   hallway conversations also talked about the potential negative
   effects of multicast in wireless and constrained networks.  Overall
   the conclusion was that the use of multicast can potentially provide
   some savings but only in some specific scenarios.

   For all improvements, the importance of metrics was frequently
   highlighted to ensure changes lead to a meaningful reduction in
   overall system carbon footprint.

3.4.  Next Steps

   The final fourth session was about conclusions and next steps.  This
   section highlights some of these conclusions.

3.4.1.  Overall strategy

   While only a few things are easy, the road ahead for making
   improvements seems clear: we need to continue to improve our
   understanding of the environmental impact, and have a continuous
   cycle of improvements that lead not just to better energy efficiency
   but to reduced overall carbon emissions.  The IETF can play an
   important part in this process, but of course there are other aspects
   beyond protocols.

   On understanding our environmental impact the first step is better
   awareness of sustainability issues in general, which helps us
   understand better where our issues are.  The second step is
   willigness to understand in detail what the causes and relationships
   within our issues.  What parts, components, or behaviours in the
   network cause what kinds of impacts?  An overall drive in the society
   to report and improve environmental impacts can be helpful in
   creating a willingness to get to this information.

   On establishing a continuous cycle of improvements, the ability to
   understand where we are, making improvements, and then seeing the
   impact of those improvements is of course central.  But obviously a
   key question is what are the potential improvements, and how can we
   accelerate them?  It should be noted that quick, large changes are
   not likely.  But a continuous stream of smaller changes can create a
   large impact over a longer period of time.

3.4.2.  Improvements

   In looking at potential improvements, it is essential that the
   associated tradeoffs can be understood, and that the role of the
   Internet in improving other areas of society is not diminished.  For
   instance, discussion in session three revealed how some changes might



Arkko, et al.            Expires August 4, 2023                [Page 10]

Internet-Draft          E-Impact Workshop Report            January 2023


   impact latency and jitter.  Given that these characteristics are an
   important factor how virtual meetings are perceived by potential
   participants, it is important that the performance of networks
   satisfies these participants at a level where there's willingness to
   use them over other potentially more environmentally harmful methods,
   such as travel.

   Note that while virtual meetings are a common example, important to
   consider different use cases, some of which may not be as obvious to
   us human users as meetings are.  Improvements may bring different or
   even larger impacts in other situations, e.g., Internet connected
   electronics might benefit from different characteristics than human
   users, e.g., with regards to support for intermittent connectivity.

   The relationships between different system components and the impact
   of various detailed design choices in network is not always apparent.
   A local change in one node may have an impact in other nodes.  When
   considering environmental sustainability, in most cases the overall
   system impact is what counts more than local impacts.  Of course,
   other factors, such as device battery life and availability of power
   may result in other preferences, such as optimising for low power
   usage of end-user devices, even at the cost of increases elsewhere.

   In terms of useful tools for building improvements, the following
   were highlighted in discussions:

   o  Masures beyond protocol design, such as implementations or
      renewable energy use.  Not everything is about protocols.

   o  Metrics, measurements, and data are very beneficial.  Carbon-aware
      metrics would in particular be very useful.  All additional
      information makes us more aware of what the environmental impacts
      are, but also enables optimization, AI-based adjustments, or
      carbon-directed computing and networking tools, and so on.

   o  It would be beneficial to be able to provide various systems a
      more dynamic ability to slow down and sleep.  Awareness of energy
      availability and type would also allow us to employ time and place
      shifting for reducing carbon impacts.

   o  When we design systems, paying attention to the used data formats
      may pay off significantly, as argued in [Moran].

   o  Possibly there's a new opportunity for deploying multicast as well
      [Navarre].

   o  Designing systems for energy constrained situations may actually
      make the resulting systems work well in several environments.

3.4.3.  Actions

   The workshop discussed a number of possible actions.  These actions
   are not about how to take specific technical solutions forward, but
   rather about how to discuss the topic going forward or what technical
   areas to focus on:

   o  We need to continue the discussion - not all questions are
      answered.  Additional discussion within the IETF will be needed.
      Continuing to connect the IETF with others in society and other
      SDOs around this topic is also useful.

   o  It is useful to find a role and a scope for IETF work in this
      area.  IETF will not develop alternative energy sources, work on
      social issues or have detailed discussions about implementation
      strategies or electronics design.  However, IETF has a role in
      measurement mechanisms, protocol design and standards - but of
      course activities in this role need to be aware of other aspects,
      such as implementation strategies.

   o  There are IETF activities on specific technologies are already
      ongoing/starting, such as metrics, or the new Time Variant Routing
      (TVR) working group.  It may be useful to start from picking the
      low-hanging fruits, such as focusing on the use of efficient data
      formats, avoiding crypto assets, and being able to carry
      information that needs to be shared for the purposes of enabling
      load and time shifting.

   o  Help initiate research activities that address some of the issues,
      such as broader gathering and sharing of measurement data,
      analysis of this data and looking business related issues such as
      the impact of peering or advertising impacts sustainability.  In
      addition, there may be need to look at research for specific areas
      of improvements that are promising but not ready for standards
      discussion.

   In summary, the goals that the IETF should have include:

   o  Full understanding of Internet's environmental impact

   o  Continuous improvement of our technology.

   o  Launching research relevant activities.

4.  Feedback

   The organizers received generally positive feedback about the
   workshop.

   One practical issue from the organizer's point of view was that due
   to the extension of the deadline, the final submissions and paper
   reviews collided in part with the IETF-115 meeting.  This lead to it
   being very difficult for the program committee and practical
   organization staff to find time for the activity.  We recommend
   avoiding such collisions in the future.

5.  Security Considerations

   The workshop itself did not address specific security topics.  Of
   course, individual changes in Internet technology or operations that
   influence environmental impacts may also influence security aspects.
   These need to be looked at for every proposed change.

   Such influence on security may come in different forms.  For
   instance:

   o  Streamlining what data is sent may improve privacy if less
      information is shared.

   o  A mechanism that makes energy consumption information available
      may be susceptible to tampering or providing false information.

   o  A mechanism that allows control of network elements for
      optimization purposes may be misused to cause denial-of-service or
      other types of attacks.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
