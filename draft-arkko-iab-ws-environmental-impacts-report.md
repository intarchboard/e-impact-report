# Introduction

The IAB ran an online workshop in December 2022 to begin to explore
and understand the environmental impacts of the Internet.

The background for the workshop was that Internet communications and
applications have both environmental costs and benefits. In the
positive direction, they can reduce the environmental impact of our
society, for instance, by allowing virtual interaction to replace
physical travel. Of course, the Internet can equally well act as an
enabler for increasing physical goods consumption, for instance,
through easing commerce.

Beyond the effects associated with its use, Internet applications do
not come for free either. The Internet runs on systems that require
energy and raw materials to manufacture and operate. While the
environmental benefits of the Internet may certainly outweigh this use
of resources in many cases, it is incumbent on the Internet industry
to ensure that this use of resources is minimized and optimized. In
many cases, this is already an economic necessity due to operational
costs. And because many consumers, businesses, and civil societies
care deeply about the environmental impact of the services and
technologies they use, there is also a clear demand for providing
Internet services with minimal environmental impact.

The role of the workshop was to discuss the Internet’s environmental
impact, discuss the evolving needs from industry, and to identify
areas for improvements and future work. A key goal of the workshop was
to call further attention to the topic and to bring together a diverse
stakeholder community to discuss these issues. This report summarises
the workshop inputs and discussions.

The workshop drew many position paper submissions, and 26 of them were
accepted. There were active discussions both in the meeting and on the
workshop mailing list with altogether 75 participants. 

Perhaps the main overriding observation is how much there is interest
and urgency on this topic, among engineers, researchers, and
businesses.

The workshop discussions and conclusions are covered in
{{discussions}}. Specific workshop sessions are also available on
YouTube, the workshop papers can be found from the workshop page, and
presentations held during the discussions can be found from the IETF
Datatracker.

The discussion at the IETF will continue after the workshop, both
around specific proposals as well as general discussion on a new
mailing list, the e-impact list (e-impact@ietf.org).

Some improvements addressing specific situations are
being discussed at the IETF, such as the Time Variant Routing (TVR)
proposal that can help optimize connectivity with systems that are
periodically on or reachable (such as satellites). We expect more
proposals in the future.

# Conventions and Definitions

# Scope

Environmental impact assessment and improvements are broad topics,
ranging from technical questions to economics, business decisions, and
policies.

Technical, standards, and research communities can help
ensure that we have a sufficient understanding of the environmental
impact of the Internet and its applications. They can also help to
design the right tools to continue to build and improve all aspects of
the Internet, such as addressing new functional needs, easing of
operations, improving performance and/or efficiency, or reducing
environmental impacts in other ways.

The workshop was expected to discuss:

* The direct environmental impacts of the Internet, including but not
  limited to energy usage by Internet systems themselves, energy usage
  of the relevant end-user devices, resources needed for manufacturing
  the associated devices, or the environmental impacts throughout the
  lifecycle of Internet systems. Discussion about the breakdown of those
  impacts across different system components and operations. Predictions about the
  potential future trends for these impacts based on changed usage
  patterns and emerging technologies.

* Discussion of the indirect environmental impacts of the Internet,
  i.e., its effects on society overall, through enabling
  communications, virtual services, or global commerce.

* Sharing information about relevant measurement metrics and data, and
  identify the need for additional metric or measurements.

* Discussing about the need for improvements or associated new functionality.

* Sharing information about the societal, business, and regulatory situation, to help identify areas of opportunity.

* Identifying areas where further technical work would be most impactful.

* Discussing specific improvement proposals.

* Discussion of past work in the IETF, IRTF and IAB in this area and the status of such work.

* Discussion of observed user behaviors as they relate to environmental impacts.

We expected that the workshop discussions connect analysis of the issues
(e.g., scale of energy consumption or carbon footprint) to industry
needs (e.g., deployment opportunities) and solutions.

Business and societal policy questions were in scope only insofar as
they inform the workshop participants about the context we are in, but
what those policies should be was not for the workshop to decide or
even extensively discuss. The scope excluded also how the technical
community works and meets, such as the question of in-person or hybrid
meetings. (Although it should be noted that the workshop itself was
run without physical meetings.)

## Practical Arrangements

The IAB discussed a potential workshop in this area during its May
2022 retreat. A call for position papers went out in August
2022. Position papers were to be submitted by end of October, a
deadline which was later extended by one week.

The meeting itself was organized as an on-line meeting, with four half-day long sessions complemented
by email discussions and the position papers submitted by the
participants.

All in all, 75 people participated in at least one session in the
workshop. Participation was by invitation only, based on the position
paper submissions. However, the program committee decided that due to
interest and differing areas of expertise, all co-authors were to be
invited, and most of them did attend. The program committee also invited a handful of
additional participants, where they were seen as providing valuable
input. Similarly, as is traditional in IAB workshops, the program
committee members and members of the IAB and IESG were offered an
opportunity to participate even in cases where they did not submit a
position paper.

The IETF secretariat and communications staff provided practical
support during the process, sending announcements, maintaining the
workshop web page with position papers, setting up mailing lists,
tracking submissions, helping with blog article submissions, and so
on.

# Workshop Topics and Discussion {#discussions}

The meeting part of the workshop was divided into four sessions:

* The first session was about the big picture and how the Internet influences the rest of the society (see {{session1}}).
* The second session focused on what we know and do not know, and how we can measure environmental impacts (see {{session2}}).
* The third session was about potential improvements (see {{session3}}).
* The final fourth session was about conclusions and next steps (see {{session4}}).

## The Big Picture {#session1}

The first session was about the big picture and how the Internet
influences the rest of the society. We also spoke about the goals of
the workshop.

Jari Arkko spoke about the what is overall involved in this topic
{{Arkko}}. Toerless Eckert talked about how the IETF has approached
this topic in the past {{Eckert}}.  Vesna Manojlovic then spoke about
the urgency of action and the importance of continuous improvement: an
incremental change every year is needed for larger savings at the end
of the decade {{Manojlovic}}. She also highlighted the need to
recognize how climate changes impact different communities in the
world, often unfairly. Finally, Eve Schooler argued that we need to be
aware of carbon footprint rather than pure energy consumption – carbon
intensity of energy sources varies {{Schooler}}.

The starting observation from this session was that the issue is much
bigger than our technology alone.  The issue influences all parts of
society, and even matters such as inequality, externalized costs, and
justice. Another key observation was that improvements come in many
forms; there is no silver bullet. The opportunity to bring together
people with different backgrounds helped us see how we approach the
topic from different angles - none of them wrong, but also none of the
sole angle to focus on either. The problems are hard enough that multiple
types of efforts are needed for major improvements.

Some of the useful tools for approaching the issue included of course technical 
solutions, but also solidarity, aiming for sufficiency, and awareness. It is important
to not stand still waiting for the perfect solution. Renewable energy and carbon awareness were seen as a part
of the solution, but not, however, sufficient by themselves.

Some of the goals for the IETF should include:

* Connecting IETF with others. Given that the issue is broad, it is
  difficult for one standards organisation to take significant
  actions. Working with in collaboration others, and understanding the
  situation beyond the strictest definition of Internet technology
  will be needed.

* Continuous improvement. As argued by Vesna Manojlovic, it is
  important that the IETF (among others) sets itself on a continuous
  improvement cycle. No single improvement will change the overall
  situation sufficiently, but over a longer period of time, even
  smaller changes every year will result in larger improvements.

* Finding the right targets for work in the Internet, and perhaps not
  solely defined by larger speeds or bigger capacity, but rather
  increased usefulness to society and declining emissions from ICT.

* Specifying what research needs to be done, i.e., where additional
  knowledge would allow us to find better improvements. For instance,
  not enough is known about effects beyond energy, such as natural
  resources used for manufacturing, or the use of
  water. Carbon-awareness and measurements across domains is also
  poorly understood today. And business model impacts -- such as the
  role of advertising on Internet's carbon footprint -- deserve more
  stody.

## Understanding the Impacts {#session2}

The second session focused on what we know and do not know, and how we
can measure environmental impacts. Michael Welzl’s presentation
focused on narrowing down the lower and upper limits of the energy use
of the Internet. There was also discussion regarding the energy consumption 
of the ICT sector and how it compares to some other selected industries 
such as aviation. Dwelling deeper into the energy consumption and the carbon
footprint of the ICT sector there was discussion regarding how the impact 
was split amongst the networks, datacenters and user devices (with the user
devices appearing to contribute to the largest fraction of the impact). 

There were also further discussions both during the presentations and in
the hallway chats regarding the press and media coverage of the potential 
environment technologies. The overall sense of the participants seemed to 
be that there was a lot of sensational headlines but they were not really
backed by measurements done by the industry and academia and were fraught 
with errors. Some of these media reports were off by quite a bit, sometimes
even by an order of magnitude (e.g. mixing up MBps vs Mbps in calculations). 

In the rest of the session we looked at both
additional data collected from the operators as well as factors that –
depending on circumstances – may drive energy consumption. These
include for instance peak capacity and energy proportionality. If
energy consumption is little affected by offered load, the ratio of
peak capacity to typical usage becomes a critical factor in energy
consumption. On the other hand, systems with energy proportionality
scale their resource and energy consumption more dynamically based on
offered load. There were also observations that showed that the energy 
consumption at grew as a step function when the peak capacity was 
reached (even instantaneously) and additional capacity was built up
by performing network upgrades to handle these new peaks. This resulted
in a overall higher baseline energy consumption even when the average 
demand did not change that much. Thus, the ability to shift load to 
reduce peak demand was highlighted as a potential way to delay increases 
in consumption when energy proportionality is lacking.


## Improvements {#session3}

The third session was about potential improvements. As discussed in
our previous blog post, there are many different types of
improvements. In the discussion we focused mostly on protocol aspects,
and looked at metrics, telemetry, routing, multicast, and data encoding 
formats.

The initial two presentations focused on metrics and telemetry with the 
premise that visibility is a very important first step (paraphrasing 
Peter Drucker's mantra of "You cannot improve what you don't measure").
There was a discussion of the scopes of emissions and it seemed that 
Scope 3 emissions were much larger in size when compared to Scope 1/2
emissions when seen from the networking vendor point of view. Thus it
seemed important that the networking vendors had to put in effort into
helping their customers measure and mitigate their environmental impact
as well. The need for standardized metrics was very clear as it helps avoid
proprietary, redundant and even contradictory metrics across vendors.

The initial and the near-term focus was related to metrics and techniques
related to energy consumption of the networking devices themselves while
the longer term focus can go into topics much further removed from the IETF
such as packaging, circular design in order to form a more holistic picture.
The overall feeling was that the topic of metrics, telemetry, and management
are quite specific and could be targets to be worked in the IETF in the near
term.

Russ White’s presentation highlighted the need to understand the tradeoffs
involved in changing forwarding decisions – such as increased stretch
and jitter. Brendan Moran talked about the potentially significant
impact of using efficiency binary formats when carrying data in
protocols. This is something that can be relatively easily adopted in
new protocols as they are developed. Indeed, some recently finished
protocols such as HTTP/2 have already chosen to use this
technique. The importance of metrics was frequently highlighted to
ensure changes lead to a meaningful reduction in overall system carbon
footprint. There were also some interesting discussions regarding the
use of multicast and whether it would help or hurt on the energy 
efficiency of communications. There were some studies and simulations 
that showed the potential gains to be had but were to be balanced against
some of the well known barriers to deployment of multicast. We also heard
from a leading CDN operator regarding their views on multicast and how it
relates to media usage and consumption models. The hallway conversations
also talked about the potential negative effects of multicast in wireless
and constrained networks.Overall the conclusion was that the use of 
multicast can potentially provide some savings but only in some specific 
scenarios.


## Next Steps {#session4}

The final fourth session was about conclusions and next steps. While
only a few things are easy, the road ahead for making improvements
seems clear: we need to continue to improve our understanding of the
environmental impact, and have a continuous cycle of improvements that
lead not just to better energy efficiency but to reduced overall
carbon emissions. The IETF can play an important part in this process,
but of course there are other aspects beyond protocols.

# Feedback 

TBD...

One practical issue from the organizer's point of view was that due to
the extension of the deadline, the final submissions and paper reviews
collided in part with the IETF-115 meeting. This lead to it being very
difficult for the program committee and practical organization staff
to find time for the activity. We recommend avoiding such collisions
in the future.

# Security Considerations

The workshop itself did not address specific security topics. Of
course, individual changes in Internet technology or operations that
influence environmental impacts may also influence security
aspects. These need to be looked at for every proposed change.

Such influence on security may come in different forms. For instance:

* Streamlining what data is sent may improve privacy if less information
is shared.

* A mechanism that makes energy consumption information available may be susceptible to tampering or providing false information.

* A mechanism that allows control of network elements for optimization purposes may be misused to cause denial-of-service or other types of attacks.
